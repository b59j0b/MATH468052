MATH4/68052   (GLM’s   and   Survival   Analysis)   Coursework   2023-24
The   marks   awarded   for   this   coursework   constitute   20%   of the   total   assessment   for   the   module.Your solutions to the coursework should   be   no   more   than   several   pages   long,   including   text,   plots,   R output and the code used.    It should take, on   average,   around   10 hours   to   finish.   You   are   advised   to   complete   all   the   computing   parts   first   before   typing   your   submission   document.
Please   read   all   the   instructions   and   advice   given   below   carefully.   The   submission   deadline   is   11:00   am   on   Friday   22   March   2024.Late   Submission   of Work:   Any   student’s   work   that   is   submitted   after   the   given   deadline   will   be   classed   as   late,   unless   an   extension   has   already   been   agreed   via   mitigating   circumstances   or   a   DASS   extension
The   following   rules   for   the   application   of   penalties   for   late   submission   are   quoted   from   the   Uni-   versity   guidance   on   late   submission   document,   version   1.3   (dated   July   2019):”Any   work   submitted   at   any   time   within   the   first   24   hours   following   the   published   submission deadline   will   receive   a   penalty   of   10%   of   the   maximum   amount   of   marks   available.      Any   work   submitted   at   any   time   between   24   hours   and   up   to   48   hours   late   will   receive   a   deduction   of   20%   of   the   marks   available,   and   so   on,   at   the   rate   of   an   additional   10%   of   available   marks   deducted   per   24   hours,   until   the   assignment   is   submitted   or   no   marks   remain.”Your submitted solutions should all be in one typed document.    This should preferably be prepared   using   LaTeX   or   R   Markdown.    Word   is   also   permissible.       For   each   question   you   should   provide   explanations   as   to   how   you   completed   what   is   required,   show   your   workings   and   also   comment   on   computational   results,   where   applicable.
When   you   include   a   plot,   be   sure   to   give   it   a   title   and   label   the   axes   correctly.When you have written or used   R   code   to   answer   any   of the   parts,   then   you   should   list   this   R   code   after the particular written   answer to which   it   applies.    This may   be   the   R   code   for   a   function   you have   written   and/or   code   you   have   used   to   produce   numerical   results,   plots   and   tables.      R   code   should   also   be   clearly   annotated.Do not use screenshots of   R code/output.   Instead, to include R code use the verbatim environment.Your file should be submitted   through   the   module   site   on   Blackboard   to   the   Turnitin   assessment   under   Assesment      Feedback   entitled   ’Coursework   (March   2024)’   by   the   above   time   and   date.    The   work   will   be   marked   anonymously   on   Blackboard   so   please   ensure   that your filename is clear but that it does not contain your name and student id number.   Similarly,   do   not   include   your   name   and   id   number   in   the   document   itself.Turnitin   will   generate   a   similarity   report   for   your   submitted   document   and   indicate   matches   to   other   sources,   including   billions   of   internet   documents   (both   live   and   archived),   a   subscription   repository   of   periodicals,   journals   and   publications,   as   well   as   submissions   from   other   students.
Please ensure that the document you   upload   represents   your   own   work   and   is   written   in   your   own   words.   The   Turnitin   report   will   be   available   for   you   to   see   shortly   after   the   due   date.
This coursework should hopefully help to   reinforce   some   of the methodology   you   have   been   study-   ing,   as   well   as   skills   in   R.The   data   we   will 代 写MATH4/68052 (GLM’s and Survival Analysis) Coursework 2023-24R

The   estimated   total   number   of   passengers   and   crew   on   board   was   2224.    The   titanic   . df   data frame   for   this   coursework   contains   the   following   variables:
●   Survived:   1   =   yes,   0   =   no
●   Pclass:   Passenger   class   -   1   (1st),   2   (2nd),   3   (3rd)
●   Sex:   ‘male’,   ‘female’
●   Age:    1   =   child   (under   18),   2   =   adult   (18   to   60),   3   =   senior   (over   60)
●   Parch:   Number   of parents   and/or   children   on   board   for   a   passenger
●   Embarked:   Port   of embarkation   -   C   =   Cherbourg,   S   =   Southampton,   Q   =   QueenstownSurvived   is   a   binary   response   variable   and   the   exercise   will   be   to   look   at   logistic   regres-   sion   models   which   can   be   used   to   predict   the   probability   that   a   passenger   survived,   given   their   particular   set   of covariate   values.Parch is to be regarded as   a   numeric   variable,   while   each   of the   others   are   factors.    The code in   the   R   script   file   start   . r   can   be   run   to   load   the   data   and   convert   the   relevant   variables   to   factors in   R   using   the   constraint   that   the   first   (reference)   level   is   set   to   zero.
1.   Write   down   the   full   additive   (but   no   interactions)   logistic   regression   model   with   a   logit   link and   explain   the   notation   you   have   used,   including   the   terms   in   the   linear   predictor.    Fit   this model to the   data.    Present the   R   ‘summary’   of your fitted   model.    Explain   and   comment   on   the   individual   Z-tests   of the   hypotheses   that   the   true   parameter   values   are   equal   to   zero.                       [5   marks]
2.    Fit   a reduced model which excludes   the   variables   Parch   and   Embarked.    Perform   an   analysis   of   deviance   to   show   that   these   two   variables   do   not   make   a   significant   contribution   to   the   fit.            [1   mark]
Can   this   model,   now   just   containing   the   variables   Pclass,   Sex,   and   Age,   be   reduced   any   further?   Provide   statistical   evidence   for   your   answer.                        [3   marks]
The   following   questions   are   all   just   based   on   using   the   fitted   model   which   includes   the   three   covariates   Pclass,   Sex,   and   Age.
3.    Calculate   the   values   for   a   new   binary   variable   in   R   called   pred   . surv   whose   i’th   element   is   equal   to   1   ifˆ(p)(xi   )   >   0.5   and   equal   to   0   ifˆ(p)(xi   )    ≤   0.5.    Here,   ˆ(p)(xi   )   denotes   the   estimated   probability   of survival   for   the   i’th   sample   case   who   has   a   vector   of covariates   xi.                               [1   mark]
Tabulate   the   values   in   Survived   against   pred   . surv   and   calculate   the   proportion   of   sample cases   correctly   classified   by   the   model.   Briefly   comment   on   the   result.                                [2   marks]
4.          (i)    Estimate the odds of survival for   an   adult   female   travelling   2’nd   class.    Briefly comment   on   the   result.                       [1   mark]
(ii)    Estimate   the   odds   ratio   of   survival   for   a   adult   female   travelling   1’st   class   to   a   senior   male   travelling   3’rd   class.   Briefly   comment   on   the   result.                                        [2   marks]
5.   Estimate   the   probability   of   survival   for   an   adult   female   travelling   2’nd   class   and   find   an   approximate   95%   confidence   interval   for   the   true   value.                                   [5   marks]
